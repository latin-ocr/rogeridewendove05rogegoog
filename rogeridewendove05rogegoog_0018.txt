The Chronicles, or, as they are very properlyt· titgeri ot
entitled, Floras Historiarum, of this author, ccm-
prise au abridged history of the world from the
Creation to the year of our Saviour’s lucarnaticn
1235, or the nineteenth year ol Henry the third,
as correctly stated by Selden. The principal di-
vision of the work is into two parts or bookS, the

first extending from the Creation to the birth ol
the Saviour, the second from the Nativity tc the
end of the period just mentioned. 0f these books
the first is subdivided into live parts or ages,
containing the history cs the world from Adam
to Noah; from the Deluge to the birth of Abra-
ham 3 from Abraham tc the death cs Saul ; from
the accession ol' David to the burning of the
Temple and the destruction os Jerusalem by Ne-
huchadnezzar3 and, lastly, from the Babylonish
captivity to the birth os Christ. This book
was abridged by Matthew of Westminster, who
adopted the title and half the preface as his own:
it occupies the first lorty pages of tho edition of
that author published m 1601. The whole oi
this,' ιιι conformity with the plan os publication
proposed by the English Historical Society, it
has been thought advisahle tc omit in the pre-
sent edition3 it contains merely an abridged
history of the Old Testament, os theseus, of
the l'ersians under Cyrus and his successore,
and Egypt under the Ptolemie8‚ compiicd l'rom
Petrus Comestor, J osephus, Methodius, J erome,
and other well known authorities The princi·
pal notices respecting Britain, hoth from the
romanoe os Geotlrey os Moumouth, are to be
found in the narrative of its occupaticn by Bru-
tuS, and in the history of king Leir3 the latter
oi which, as the foundation of one os the most
interesting perhaps ol the plays of Shakspere,
is here subjoiucd:
