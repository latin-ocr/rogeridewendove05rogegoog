sansacu. xxxiii

The sallacy in the remaining argument of the
editor, conclusive though he calls it, is almost too
palpable to need exposure. Itis drawn from an
assertion of Paris himsels, at the eud ol the ac·
count os John’s embassy te the emperor os Mo·
rocco in 1213, where he says,‘ audiente M atthaeo,
qui et haec scripsit et narravit! Itis certainly
clear irem this that Paris did write the paragraph
in question, and probably the account which pre·
cedes it; but, until a MS. os Wendover be dis·
covered that contains either, it cannot be allow-
ed, of course, to have any weight.

It would not have been thought necessary to
say so much upon this point, had not the state-
ments above referred to been adopted hythe Duc
de LuyneS, and introduced in his prelace to the
translation es Matthew Paris, lately published.
As this is likely to be, and deservedly so from
the very able manner in which it has been exe·
cuted, a standard work upon the Continent, it
has been thought dne to chdover to set his
claims in their true light.

Os the present edition, the first of this writer
that has ever issued from the prese, a lew words
will suffice. The text is taken srom the only
manuscriptos Wendover believed now to be ex-
tant, the property of the late Mr. Douce, and
bequeathed hy him, with the rest ol his MSS.
and printed books, to the Bodleian library. It
is a folio volume en vellum, written in two

‚columns almost at the close probably ofthe thir-
teenth century. Itis unl'ortunately imperfect iu
two places: in one from the year 879 to 894,
where the history has been continued in the text
from an excellent MS. cf Matthew of Westmin-
ster, who fortunately at this point is an exact
copyist ol Wendover, collated with the edition
