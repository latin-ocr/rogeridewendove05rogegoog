narrative os the events 01 the years 1191 and
1192, where thetext has been supplied 11016
what remeius 01 the chdover MS. destroyed

Throughout the three last volumes the reader
will find these variations caresully preserved,
that the present may form as complete 666111-

no positive information‚ further than that it was
purchased by Mr. Donce at the sale 01 books be·
longing to tho late Sir John Sebright, in the
catalogue 01 which it is described as the Flores
Historiarum 01 Matthew 01 westminster.

The editor 01 Rishanger indeed thinks that
‘there 066 scarcely be any reasonable doubt that
⁰ the MS. in question is the same with one which, in
the year 1585, belonged to one Doctor Matthew
Carew,' and gives the following reason for his opi-
nion, namely‚ that 1110 transcriber 01 66 extract
from this MS„ now in the Sloane collection, MS.

occur at the end 01 the chronicle, not understand-
ing the word ‘tenuit’ as written in the manu-
script, has made a kind 01 sac-simile 01 the MS.

the Douce manuscript! But it is inconceivable
whence the editor can have derived his 161011116-

· tion. since, in the lines alluded to, with which our

history concludes, no such word as ‘tenuit’ is to
be found!
