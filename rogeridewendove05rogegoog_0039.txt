Wendover's death, and therefore is not to
be preferred in evidence to those MSS. of Mat-
tbew Paris and Wendover, of a much earlier
period, which distinctly state, the oue as quoted
by Wats in the Variae Lectiones, that in the

to signify so great an interval as fifty yearS,
namely, from 1170 to 1220, when ‘Matthaeus
