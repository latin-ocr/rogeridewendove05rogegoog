atis, de loco ipso, ubi beati martyris offusus erat nune.
sanguia, massam pulveris secum portaturus abs·

tulit, in qua apparebat cruore servato rubuisse
martyrum caedem, persecutore pallente. Quibus

ita gestis, innumera hominum turba eodem die ad
Dominum conversa est!

The sources whence Wendover obtained the ξνοιιιιᾶοιοιΙ
informatiou contained iu the following pagos are hldlrl’lm
as various as the subjects of which he treats.
He has gathered his‘ Flowers' in gordens at homo
and abroad‚ and it is to he feared that many
have suffered from having been too rudelyhaudled.
Itis evident that in several places the sense has
been ohscured‚ if not corrupted, by his anxiety to
compress his information into a small compass3
although, generally speaking, he hasbeen care-
ful to retain the words of the author whom he is
quoting. One of his principa] authorities in
matters of foreign history appears to have been
Sigobert‚ the monle of Gemblours, from whom he
frequently transcribes verbatim whole passages
and who has very often been the cause of many
chronological errors which will be found in the
work. From Hermannus Contractus, Marianus
Scotus, and the Byzantina historians, Theopha-
nes, Cedren, and othere, he appears also to have
horrowed, whence, in the earlier parts of his
chronicis, his stylo naturally partakes more of
the character of those from whom be is copying3
at the same time that, where in the compilation
he has moulded the material into his own form,
it will be found to he that of plain aud unatl'cct·
ed narrative. In the later portions of his his·
tory, the writers of his own land are the chief
sources of the events that he registers. Beda,
