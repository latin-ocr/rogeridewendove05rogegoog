Phaeaca. xxxi

year 1235 it has been written by another hand
than that 01 Matthew Paris. The numerous in·
terpolations, the different circumstances related
connected with the same story‚—those, 101 in·
stance, amongst many others, in the account 01
the visit 01 the archhishop 01 Α11001110 10 Eng-

land in ¹1228, and the diametricallyopposite state· ·

ments 01 the one and the other in reference to
the plundcr 01 S. Alhan’s in 1217,² all concur to
shew that Matthcw Paris was not the writer 01
the chronicle in question3 and 11 so, to whom, 11
1101 10 Wendorer, are we 10 look 101 the author-
shipl

But to the second reason 101 his conclusion
adduced hythe editor 01 Rishanger. He says
that in the Douce MS. ‘ there is a marginal note
stating, that at the year 1190 a new chronicler
continued the worlr. On this point the editor
has been strangely misinl'ormed3 although, 0101111
there were such a note extant, we should be very
caresul how we received the testimony 01 0 much
later hand. The marginal note in question,
however, is to he found at the commencement 01
the year 1189, and is as follows, ‘ Huc usquein
libro cronicarum lobannis abbatis? It is writ-
ten in very saint 11111, 01 rather, as it appears,
with 0 kind 01 lead pencil‚ a writing with which
all who consult MSS. 01 the middle ages are
well acquainted, and has been hy a still later
hand transcrihcd on the opposite margin thus,
‘Usque hoc cronica Johannis abbatis et hic
finis! But how are we to conclude that all he-
1010 this tima uras the work 01 ahhot John, and
all since that year by another chroniclerl N o-
thing is more common with writers 01 chronicles
