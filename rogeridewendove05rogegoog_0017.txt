from his work and elsewhere. A manuscript
chartulary of S. Alban’s abbey, written at the
close of the fiftecnth century, describes him as
the man to whom the historiens of England owe
nearly all which they have. In this chartulary,
however, the scribe has committed an error in
stating that Wendover’s history extendcd only so
far asto the reign of Henry the second3 we
shall presently see that the third king of that
name is evidently intended. Bale speaks of him
as a man from his earliest years most aeger in
his pursuit of knowledge. Pits, from Stowe,
writes that he was a diligent searcher into those
things which were going on around him, and that
he carefully and honestly registcred all the most
remarkable events of his time, which either he
had himself seen, or had received from trust·

the Historiae Novorum of Eadmer,¹ observes,
that all the former partos the history of Mat-

the nineteenth year of Henry the third, is due
to Wendover. ,
