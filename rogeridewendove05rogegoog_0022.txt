of our own country are meagre in the extreme.
The history of England indeed atthis period is to
be sought rather in that of the Roman empne,
in the works of Caesar, Tacitus, Dion Cassius,
Suetonius, and others, whom Wendover, we re·
gret to say, has rejected for the fables of Geof·
frey of Monmouth, whom he has made his al·
most sole authority. The names of Caractacus
and Boadicea are nowhere found in the chro-
nicle, whilst that of Aruiragus, the creation pro·
bably of Geoffrey or of Walter of Oxford, oc·
cupies a conspicuous place. In the death of
Severus, the historias of Dion and of Herodian
remain unconsulted, whilst the account given by
Geoffrey is followed with inconceivable blind·
ness. The only portioris of this part of tho
history which the Editor feels himself at liberty
to print are the extracts following ; the one con-
taining an account of the passion of England’s
first martyr, which, although a compilation from

other well known lives,¹ differs from that by
Beda, and is told hy our historian in his own
way; the second extract, because it connects
the history of Britain after the departure of
the Romans with the point at which the pre·
sent text has been commenced.
