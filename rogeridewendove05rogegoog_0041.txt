than to notice where other historiens crased their
labours Wendover informs his readers in his
text the years in which Marianus Scotus and
sigebert 01 Gemblours ended their histories3 but
such statements, we know, cannot imply that all
before those respective years was by their hand.

. And so in the present instance, 11 the writer 01

the Introduction will turn to Pits‚ edit. 1619,
p. 255, he will there read that John 01 Hagus·
taldt, or Barbam, continued his chronicle to
the first year 01 the reign 01 king Richard the
first, namely,1189, a date which exactly tallies
with the marginal note. This is not offered as
the solution 01 the difficulty, although it would
appear to be a very simple and natural one.

There is still a rather curious circumstance
connected with this point that is deserving our
consideration, tending, as it 11001110 shew that
the earlier as wellas the later portions 01 the
chronicle were written by the same haud. It
hasbeen before observed that Wendover in the
first book 01 his chronicle has copied verbatim
many paragraphs 110111 the Historia Scholastica
01 Petrus Comestor; and it is well known that
that writer died in 1178, and that the Historia
was written between 1169 and 1175. Doubtless‚
then, copies 01 that work may have been sent into
England before118‘i; but it appears from New·
come¹ that in the time 01 John 01 Studham, the
twenty-first abbat, who died in the year 1214, by
the industry 01 Raymoud the prior a copy 01
that book was obtained 101 the library 01 the
abbey3 and it is mentioned in such a manner as
would lead us to suppose that no other copy
had existed there besore.
