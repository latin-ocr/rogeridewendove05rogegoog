l’llllFACE. XXXV

A MS. olWeudover, commeneing with the Na-
tivity, is spoken os in a note prelixcd to a copy
of Matthew of Westminster, iu the Bodleian li-
brary [MS. Laud, 572], as having belonged to
Sir christophor Heidon, knight, of Norl'olk, but
we have no means of ascertaiuing whether that
MS. is at present in existence or not. Nichols,
indeed, in his history of Leicestershire, has made
the MSS. ol Wendovcr and Paris identical.

In the notes to the present edition the editor
hasbeen anxious to say only so much as appear-
ed to be uselul sor the general purpose of il·
lustration, orto amend the chronology, which,
often confused, owing to the different periods
at which the year was commenced hy different
authorS, or from inaccuracy, arising from the
scanty means of information at the time, later ·
researcheS, and greater opportunities ior arriving
at the truth, have enabled him to correct.

It only remains sor him to add his best thanks
to ΜΓ. Bentley lor the attention and expedition
with which tho work hasbeen passed through
thc press, as also to Mr. Fehon sor the great
caro with which the index has been compiled.
